                        <div className="answer"> Tech@NYU has become more a community than an organization that you "join." The Tech@NYU executive board (e-board) plans and runs events geared toward students who want to learn more about different topics in the tech industry, but anyone can come to these events! So, bring your friends! Bring your grandma! We want to create spaces where you can easily talk to and learn from other people about tech.</div>

                        <div className="answer"> At the beginning of each semester we open applications for our e-board. Positions we recruit for depend on what roles we need filled and we tend to recruit more heavily in the fall than in the spring. If you're interested in joining our board look out for applications on our Facebook page and here on the website as we near the beginnings of each semester. </div>

                        <div className="answer"> We have various roles and teams within the e-board. Normally each team will have a team lead and one or two other team members. Aside from the event teams, the e-board also has infrastructure, marketing, and other operational roles. Check out our <a href="#/about">about</a> page to find out more about the different teams in Tech@NYU and see additional information on our e-board members.</div>
